    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A an unleavened griddle bread from India which is similar to pita bread. It is also known as roti. Ideally, I use the traditional Indian roti griddle called a 'tava.'</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups durum wheat flour</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>¾ cup water</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a medium bowl, stir together the flour, salt, water and oil, until the mixture pulls away from the sides. Turn the dough out onto a well floured surface. Knead until smooth and pliable, about 10 minute.</li>
            <li>Preheat an unoiled skillet or tava to medium high heat. Divide dough into 12 equal parts, form into rounds and cover with a damp cloth. Flatten the balls with the palm of your hand, then use a rolling pin to roll out each piece into a 6 to 8 inch diameter round.</li>
            <li>Cook the roti for 1 minute before turning over, then turn again after another minute. The roti should have some darker brown spots when finished. Best served warm.</li>
        </ol>
